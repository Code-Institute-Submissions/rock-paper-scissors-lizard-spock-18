# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

## Introduction

### Origin

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors, created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla. Sam Kass explains he created the expanded game because it seemed like most games of Rock Paper Scissors with people you know would end in a tie. (reference the-big-bang-theory.com)

As Sheldon explains, "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors." (reference the-big-bang-theory.com)

### Purpose

Making decisions can sometimes become a daunting task. The "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" game was created to lighten the load. Picture a couple of scenarios:
- You can't decide which car to buy?
  - if the computer wins it the Lamborghini, if you win it the Maserati.
- It's vacation time?
  - if the computer wins I'm going to Mauritius, if I win I'm going to the Bahamas.

Life is full of decisions, I'm certain you can think of more. The game is simple and intuitive. To make a decision you can decide whether it's done on a single run or the best of 3 runs or however many times you feel you need to make that decision. By setting no limit, because you have no decision to make, you can challenge yourself and see how well you can do against the computer.

The user clicks on one of the buttons: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard or Spock, and the computer responds with its choice.

### The players choices

The players' choices are then displayed below the buttons, and in between, the messages "It's a draw", "Player wins" or "Computer wins" are displayed depending on the outcome of the hands played by the players.

The game choice section had a couple of challenges hence why I decided to put it off for now. The feature offer the user the of playing a Best of Three game or Best of Five game or an Infinite game. The player will make a choice by clicking or selecting a radio button.
