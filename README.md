# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Making decisions can sometimes become a daunting task. The "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" game was created to lighten the load. Picture a couple of scenarios:
- You can't decide which car to buy?
  - if the computer wins it the Lamborghini, if you win it the Maserati.
- It's vacation time?
  - if the computer wins I'm going to Mauritius, if I win I'm going to the Bahamas.

Life is full of decisions, I'm certain you can think of more. The game is simple and intuitive. To make a decision you can decide whether it's done on a single run or the best of 3 runs or however many times you feel you need to make that decision. By setting no limit, because you have no decision to make, you can challenge yourself and see how well you can do against the computer.
